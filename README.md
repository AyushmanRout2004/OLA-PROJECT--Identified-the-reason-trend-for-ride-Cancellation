OLA Power BI Ride Cancellation Project



📌 Project Overview
🔍 Objective: Analyze ride cancellations from OLA's 100,000 synthetic booking records for Bengaluru.

🧹 Data Preparation: Cleaned and processed data from multiple sources using SQL.

🧠 Analysis Focus: Identified key trends, reasons, and patterns behind ride cancellations.

🚗 Behavioral Insights: Examined the role of vehicle types and customer behavior in cancellations.

🛠 Tools Used:

SQL for querying, aggregating, and transforming data

Power BI for building interactive dashboards and visualizations

📉 Key Outcome: Implemented a new strategy based on insights which led to a 10% reduction in ride cancellations.

📊 Visualization: Presented findings through dynamic and user-friendly Power BI dashboards.

📊 Key Insights and Features
✅ Ride Volume Over Time: Daily trends in booking activity
✅ Booking Status Breakdown: Success vs Cancelled vs Incomplete rides
✅ Top Vehicle Types by Ride Distance
✅ Customer & Driver Ratings Comparison
✅ Reasons for Ride Cancellations (Customer vs Driver)
✅ Revenue by Payment Methods & Top Customers
✅ Impact of Weekends and Match Days on Ride Volume and Value

📂 Dataset
Size: 100,000 rows of synthetic ride data for Bengaluru

Columns Include:

Booking ID, Booking Status, Customer ID, Vehicle Type

Pickup/Drop Locations, Ride Distance, Payment Method

VTAT, CTAT, Driver & Customer Ratings

Cancellation Reasons & Incomplete Ride Tags

Special Rules:

62% successful rides, <7% canceled by customers, <18% by drivers

Incomplete rides kept <6%

Booking value & volume spike on weekends and match days

🚀 Why This Project Stands Out?
🔹 Real-time Cancellation Analysis – Explore dynamic causes for cancellations
🔹 Data-Driven Recommendations – Reduction of cancellation rate by 10%
🔹 Custom Insights for Match Days & Weekends
🔹 Seamless SQL-Power BI Integration

🌟 Project Highlights
📌 Total Rides Analyzed: 100,000
📌 Customer Cancellation Rate: Under 7%
📌 Driver Cancellation Rate: Under 18%
📌 Incomplete Rides: Under 6%
📌 Improvement: Strategy reduced total cancellation rate by 10%
